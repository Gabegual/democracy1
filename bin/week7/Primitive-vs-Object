Section Handout 9 Primitive vs Object

1. Primitive vs. Objects
	Let's say a student writes the following line of code in a predicate method (i.e., a method
	that returns a boolean):
	public boolean IsNameQ() {
	String name = readLine("Enter name: ");
	return (name == "Q");
}
	The author of this code thinks that the program will return true if the player’s name is
		"Q". What’s the problem here?
	Now consider if the code were written as:
	
	public boolean IsNameQ() {
	String name = readLine("Enter name: ");
	char ch = name.charAt(0);
	return ((ch == 'Q') && (name.length() == 1));
}
	How is the code above different with respect to checking for equality with the value "Q
	
	In the first method--- 
	the student uses a generalize method
	expecting the user to input a name with Q, 
	and returns name == Q but it doesnt give exact parameters,
	so a user can input a longer name with out q and nothing runs.
	
	In the second method---
	the student sets two parameters a String and a Char, 
	the student returns a char and index 0
	and sets name length at 1. This makes the user input
	a name with only one letter and the letter has to be a Q 
	to be returned.
